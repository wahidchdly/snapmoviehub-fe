# There are some sizes of the design from Figma that I need to criticize

1. The font is not 'Poppins'.
2. Many pixel sizes are incorrect such as width, height, left, top and so on.
3. The body height size is 2379px. It is not good for better display.
4. And, position is almost absolute, whereas the type of position is not fit for all components.
5. That is all that I remembered.
